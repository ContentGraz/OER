# Metrics Matter [#](#metrics-matter)

## Teaser


Knowledge is power. To recognize success, a company must effectively measure and know where it stands in the market and what its long-term investments and goals are. Measuring with the appropriate metrics will help a company to make the right decisions for its short and long-term goals.

## Context

Startups are focused on very rapid growth. Successful startups are experimental and data-driven, and their metrics are closely related to the metrics for measuring the success of content, which is often essential for the thriving of a startup. Startups and digital content live in the same digital ecosystems.

This lecture provides an introduction to startup metrics from the perspective of a digital entrepreneur, investor and consultant.

## Description

### The data driven approach

> “If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it”

![Metrics Matter](/assets/images/_general/MetricsMatter.png)

To define your organisation’s success, you need to define the metrics you will be using. A metric gives meaning to measurement, and to find the right metrics you need to know what supports your company best. There is no one-size-fits-all-solution: Which metrics you chose depends on what business you support, and, speaking of content, which business problem you want to solve via content. Many successful organizations have developed their own, highly specific metrics. A lot of them are open and can be analyzed and compared via services like [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/ "Baremetrics: Subscription Analytics & Insights for Stripe, Braintree, Recurly & more!").

> “A data-based decision-making culture is the single most important competitive edge of start-ups against incumbents. But most startups are in love with their product and rather work on a “Product founder fit “ than a “Product-market fit"."

– Dieter Rappold, Founder, and CEO of Speedinvest Pirates

There are different main types of metrics. Often they are classified by the categories:

*   Quality
*   Quantity
*   Efficiency

Proven metrics for start-ups, which can be used for a customized metrics strategy, are:

1.  [Customer Acquisition Cost](https://neilpatel.com/blog/customer-acquisition-cost/ "Customer Acquisition Cost: The One Metric That Can Determine Your Company’s Fate") (CAC)
2.  [Retention](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-retention-metrics "10 Customer Retention Metrics & How to Measure Them")
3.  [Customer Churn Rate](https://www.retentionscience.com/blog/why-measuring-your-customer-churn-rate-increases-revenue/ "Customer Churn Rate: Definition, Measuring Churn and Increasing Revenue | ReSci")
4.  [Customer Lifetime Value](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6653(199824)12:1<17::AID-DIR3>3.0.CO;2-K "Customer lifetime value: Marketing models and applications, Paul D.Berger and  Nada I.Nasr") (LTV)
5.  [Product Metabolism](https://venturefizz.com/stories/boston/why-product-metabolism-every-startup-s-first-kpi "Why Product Metabolism Is Every Startup’s First KPI | VentureFizz")
6.  [Viral coefficient](https://andrewchen.co/viral-coefficient-what-it-does-and-does-not-measure/ "Viral coefficient: What it does and does NOT measure at andrewchen")

The key question is: **When to apply which metrics?** To answer this question, it is crucial to differentiate between the different metrics, like input and output metrics. Output metrics reflect the results, and input metrics indicate actions. Above all, before you start you should base your decision on your data.

### What to achieve by Metrics? Product Market Fit (PMF) as a condition for Sustainable Growth [#](#product-market-fit-pmf-sustainable-growth)

The [Product/Market Fit](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html "EE204 Business Management for Engineers and Computer Scientists") (PMF) is no metric but it should guide a start-up's analytics efforts as soon as product specific information from the market can be gathered. The Product/market fit is the degree to which a product satisfies strong market demand. Measuring the Product/market fit is the first step for a company to gather feedback from the market and to evaluate the customers' interest in a specific products. The Product-Market Fit can be considered as one of the main orientation points of a start-up's successful work.

**To focus on the PMF metric helps us in:**

*   Respecting fundamentals such as a sustainable business model
*   Striving for long-term profitability (and not growth at all cost)
*   Showing how revenue ultimately surpasses costs (rather than making money straight away)

**The cons of the MFP metric are manageable but still relevant:**

*   It is unclear what to track, when, and how
*   Lack of focus on product-market fit

### Find your personal North Star Metric (NSM) [#](#find-your-personal-north-star-metric-nsm)

![North Star png](/assets/images/_general/NorthStar.png.jpg)

Whatever you are doing - you need a metric which gives you an orientation for all of your business, often called a North Star Metric. It measure's your overall company success. Just as the North Star is needed to align the entire coordinate system of the sky, the North Star metric provides a reference point for all other metrics, and thus for all of an organization's actions.

Using the NSM Metric means finding the one metric that matters and your one metric that best captures the core value of the product and it also reflects your PMF. The NSM will often be an amalgam of several metrics. Since it should measures the overall quality of your endeavour it will be an output metric.

A North Star Metric is essential if a company wants to reach its maximum growth potential. To grow in long term, a company will need to develop a long-term growth strategy and for that, the ‘North Star Metric’ should be in this stratgy's center.

When defining your NSM the company needs to be aware that “revenue” is a bad choice. Revenue is what the customer pays in return for the product. To measure the sustainability of your project a north star metric is focused on the value the product brings to people. Having revenue as an NSM means the company doesn’t have a clear long-term strategy.

The key reason, why a Company should have a North Star Metric or in other words the **pros:**

*   **Orientation:** the NSM gives more orientation to the company itself, the core business, and the products which are sold
*   **Core Value:** NSM captures the core value of the business and the company.
*   **Focus:** The NSM provides a clear focus, and everyone has the same goal.
*   **Clarity:** It is clear to everyone how and what the company is doing on a short- and long-term basis
*   **Customer focus:** the first concern is bringing value to the customer
*   **Growth:** efficient long-term growth as the company is more focused on value

### The AARRR funnel - a proven combination of metrics

Did you hear about the AARRR funnel? It’s all about Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue [#](#did-you-hear-about-the-aarrr-funnel-its-all-about-acquisition-activation-retention-referral-and-revenue)

The first A stands for the Acquisition. At his stage of the funnel on organization has to find out where the customers are coming from and where there is enough space for the company to grow. A well known acquisition metric is conversion rate: the percentage of visitors who perform a certain desired action.

The next A stands for Activation and is related to the client's personal first experience with the product. It depends on how customers feel about a product and the company behind it before consumed or use the product. At this stage metrics indicate the value of your product and how willing customers are to use and ultimately pay for it.

A well known activation metric is CAC – Customer Acquisition Cost. CAC shows the costs of convincing a potential customer to buy a product. This can be organic or paid. To explain this, an example follows: When you go into a shop in town and buy something, this purchase is an organic acquisition for the shop. However, if you have been targeted by a flyer or other advertising, then it is a paid acquisition.

Let’s move on to the R which stands for Retention: It indicates the quality of growth. And that means how many customers who have bought from the company once come back and how often. A differentiation is made here between:

*   DAU = Daily Active Users
*   WAU = weekly active users
*   MAU = monthly active users

Especially in digital sales, these figures are particularly important, through various marketing campaigns, of course, they also try to push the numbers up and boost more sales. This is exactly why you as a customer always receive advertising and newsletters from various companies.

The second R stands for Referral Metrics and expresses the willingness of customers to recommend a product to their peers in figures. In exactly these metrics, you are counted as a loyal customer, If you always buy from the same company, the same brand, and/or the same product, then you are one of the most important assets for a company. You are, in other words, the brand lover and super follower.

And last but not least the Revenue Metrics. It shows how to increase revenue and how the company can push up sales figures and profits respectively. In this section the Customer Lifetime Value is essential. The CLTV shows the net profit from one customer over his / her lifetime. If you are one of the brand lovers or super followers of a company, then you will be treated accordingly and can enjoy some goodies. However, if you're more like a casual shopper, then you're not going to get the benefits. For this reason, loyal customers are always more important to companies than new customers. Finding new customers is easier than finding loyal ones - similar to friendships!

It optimizes the business journey and set up some valuable and actionable metric goals for a company and especially for start-ups. For long-term growth, a start-up needs to have an attribution model, a bidding model, to know where the customers are coming from, and which measures to take. The Attribution model means to know better which of your spending is doing great and which not. The retention metrics show a company where new growth is possible. In saturated markets, it is hard to get new customers and to increase sales. For that, it is important to know, where market growth is possible and where new customers can be fetched.

Not only for start-ups the AARRR is important. Also, long-existing companies should have a look at the five most important metrics, because those metrics effectively measure the company’s growth and are at the same time simple and actionable.
