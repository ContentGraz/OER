# Metrics Matter [#](#metrics-matter)

## Teaser


Knowledge is power. To recognize success, a company must not only effectively measure and know where it stands in the market and what its long-term investments and goals are but also which stakeholders are affected internally and externally and what group dynamics are formed between them. Measuring the appropriate metrics, a good pricing strategy and a proper stakeholder analysis will help a company to know, define, and make the right decisions for its short and long-term goals.

## Context

Startups are companies that are focused on very rapid growth, for which content, content marketing, and content strategy are often critical. Successful startups are experimental and data-driven, and their metrics also play a key role in measuring the success of content. This lecture provides an introduction to startup metrics, the concepts of which are also relevant for content created in other contexts.

There is a double relationship between startup metrics and content metrics:

1. Many startups need content strategies, often very special content strategies.
2. The metrics for measuring persuasive content are very similar and sometimes identical with the metrics for new and fast growing businesses.


## Description

### The data driven approach

> “If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it”

![Metrics Matter](/assets/images/_general/MetricsMatter.png)

To define your organisation’s success, you need to define the metrics you will be using. A metric gives meaning to measurement, and to find the right metrics you need to know what supports your company best. Theren is no one-size-fits-all-solution: Which metrics you chose depends on what business you support, and, speaking of content, which business problem you want to solve via content.

There are many different main types of metrics. Often they are classified by the categories:

*   Quality
*   Quantity
*   Efficiency

The best metrics for start-ups are:

1.  Product Market Fit (PMF)
2.  Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
3.  Retention
4.  Churn
5.  Lifetime Value (LTV)
6.  Product Metabolism
7.  Viral Coefficient

The key question is: **When to achieve which metrics?** To answer this question, it is crucial to differentiate between the different metrics, like input and output metrics. Output metrics reflect the results, and input metrics indicate actions. Above all, before you start you should base your decision on your data.

> “A data-based decision-making culture is the single most important competitive edge of start-ups against incumbents. But most startups are in love with their product and rather work on a “Product founder fit “ than a “Product-market fit"."

– Dieter Rappold, Founder, and CEO of Speedinvest Pirates

### Types of startup metrics

#### Product Market Fit (PMF) & Sustainable Growth [#](#product-market-fit-pmf-sustainable-growth)

The Product/market fit is the degree to which a product satisfies strong market demand. To this, the Product/market fit is the first step for a company to gather feedback from the market and engage interest in a specific product from their customers. The Product-Market Fit – or shortly PMF - can be considered as one of the main metrics of start-up successful work.

**FMP metric helps us in:**

*   Knowing fundamentals such as a profitable business model and achieving product-market fit has been neglected
*   Profitability (and not growth at all cost)
*   Show how revenue ultimately surpasses costs (rather than making money straight away)

**The cons of the MFP metric are manageable but still relevant:**

*   It is unclear what to track, when, and how
*   Lack of focus on product-market fit

### Find your personal North Star Metric (NSM) [#](#find-your-personal-north-star-metric-nsm)

![North Star png](/assets/images/_general/NorthStar.png.jpg)

Whatever you are doing - you need a metric which gives you an orientation for all of your business, often called a North Star Metric. Just as the North Star is needed to align the entire coordinate system of the sky, the North Star metric provides a reference point for all other metrics, and thus for all of an organization's actions.

A North Star Metric helps measure the success of a product in the company and is also essential to reach the maximum business growth potential. Using the NSM Metric means finding the one metric that matters and your one metric that best captures the core value of the product and it also reflects your PMF. The NSM will often be an amalgam of several metrics. Since it should measures the overall quality of your endeavour it will be an output metric.

A North Star Metric is essential if a company wants to reach its maximum growth potential. To grow in long term, a company will need to develop a long-term growth strategy and for that, the ‘North Star Metric’ should be at the center of the growth strategy.

When defining your NSM the company needs to be aware that “Revenue” is a bad decision for that, because NSM is a way to sustain your project. Revenue is what the customer pays in return for the product, whereas a north star metric is a value the product brings to people. Also having revenue as an NSM is misleading because it means the company doesn’t have a clear long-term strategy.

The key reason, why a Company should have a North Star Metric or in other words the **pros:**

*   **Orientation:** the NSM gives more orientation to the company itself, the core business, and the products which are sold
*   **Core Value:** NSM captures the core value of the business and the company.
*   **Focus:** The company provides a clear focus, and everyone has the same goal.
*   **Clarity:** It is clear to everyone how and what the company is doing on a short- and long-term basis
*   **Customer focus:** the first concern is bringing value to the customer
*   **Growth:** efficient long-term growth as the company is more focused on value

### The AARRR funnel - a proven combination of metrics

Did you hear about the AARRR funnel? It’s all about Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue [#](#did-you-hear-about-the-aarrr-funnel-its-all-about-acquisition-activation-retention-referral-and-revenue)

As you can read in the headline, the AARRR funnel deals with Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue. It optimizes the business journey and set up some valuable and actionable metric goals for a company and especially for start-ups. For long-term growth, a start-up needs to have an attribution model, a bidding model, to know where the customers are coming from, and which measures to take. The Attribution model means to know better which of your spending is doing great and which not. The retention metrics show a company where new growth is possible. In saturated markets, it is hard to get new customers and to increase sales. For that, it is important to know, where market growth is possible and where new customers can be fetched.

Not only for start-ups the AARRR is important. Also, long-existing companies should have a look at the five most important metrics, because those metrics effectively measure the company’s growth and are at the same time simple and actionable.

The first A stands for the Acquisition metrics and shows where the customers coming from and where there is enough space for the company to grow. The CAC – Customer Acquisition Cost – shows the costs of convincing a potential customer to buy a product. This can be organic or paid. To explain this, an example follows: When you go into a shop in town and buy something, this purchase is an organic acquisition for the shop. However, if you have been targeted by a flyer or other advertising, then it is a paid acquisition.

The next A stands for Activation and means the client's personal first experience with the product. In other words, exactly how you feel about a product and the company behind it when you have consumed or used the product.

Let’s move on to the R which stands for Retention: It indicates the quality of growth. And that means how many customers who have bought from the company once come back and how often. A differentiation is made here between:

*   DAU = Daily Active Users
*   WAU = weekly active users
*   MAU = monthly active users

Especially in digital sales, these figures are particularly important, through various marketing campaigns, of course, they also try to push the numbers up and boost more sales. This is exactly why you as a customer always receive advertising and newsletters from various companies.

The second R stands for Referral Metrics and expresses the willingness of customers to recommend a product to their peers in figures. In exactly these metrics, you are counted as a loyal customer, If you always buy from the same company, the same brand, and/or the same product, then you are one of the most important assets for a company. You are, in other words, the brand lover and super follower.

And last but not least the Revenue Metrics. It shows how to increase revenue and how the company can push up sales figures and profits respectively. In this section the Customer Lifetime Value is essential. The CLTV shows the net profit from one customer over his / her lifetime. If you are one of the brand lovers or super followers of a company, then you will be treated accordingly and can enjoy some goodies. However, if you're more like a casual shopper, then you're not going to get the benefits. For this reason, loyal customers are always more important to companies than new customers. Finding new customers is easier than finding loyal ones - similar to friendships!
