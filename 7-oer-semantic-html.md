## Summary

Why should content strategists know anything about HTML CSS and Javascript? At the beginning of his course on frontend technologies Heinz wittenbrink justified why we should learn about angle brackets and alt attributes. The discussion is still ongoing.

## Relevance

The web is one of the most important channels for digital content. At the same time, however, it is a platform for its own types of content, because linked information that can also be further linked at will only exists on the Web. In order to understand this special role of the Web for content, one must understand its special properties as a digital platform and thus above all the design of HTML, the language for Web content and Web applications. Without this knowledge, one cannot judge whether one's own content actually exploits the possibilities of the web and will optimally reach current and future users.

## Description

To get to grips with the basics of coding does not necessarily mean to become a programmer. It means to know about the technical formats of content which make it possible to transmit, to transform and to present it digitally. It makes it possible to make sure
- that the content can be optimally processed and
- that the processing corresponds to the semantics of the content (that is the more important part).

HTML allows a description of content for processing by machines and in particular for processing for the universal hyper mediuim *world wide web*. If this description does not truly match the content, then the processing falls short. Therefore, in order to know if the description is adequate to the content, a person responsible for the content must understand its characteristics to the extent that one can judge if it is adequate.

Two examples: visual design of content and search engine optimization

### Visual design

A good visual design corresponds to the properties of the content. On the web, cascading style sheets are used for visual design. Cascading style sheets connect the markup styles. For example, headings are displayed in bold, and important headings are displayed in a larger font than smaller headings. This presentation only works if the headings are actually marked up as headings in the HTML. Only someone who is responsible for the content can judge whether the correct text is marked as a heading. If he can't make this judgement with the source code, then the content is bound to a certain content management system or maybe even only to a very specific technique to process it, it can't be used independently.



### Search engine optimization

Search engine optimization basically means describing content in such a way that it can be easily found by search engines. This is also done by using HTML to describe the content. The search engine recognizes, for example, what the title of a document is or what the particularly important headings are. Again, without knowledge of this markup, it is not possible to track whether the search engine is actually using the correct parts of the text. Even lesser known HTML tags such as those for metadata are relevant to search engines.

Being able to produce semantic HTML means something similar to being able to prepare a manuscript well for printing. It ensures that the processing corresponds to the content.


## HTML Knowledge, Content Management and the Role of Content Strategists

One could argue that there are enough means to mark up HTML using various graphical tools and that the producers of these tools should be responsible for the correct markup. On the one hand, this idea is unrealistic, because in practice, relatively bad HTML is produced in many cases. On the other hand, this concept misses the role of content strategy. Content strategists are not the producers of content but the people responsible for a content oriented approach to content management, and this management must always deal with the content as a technical artifact, otherwise it couldn't be managed at all. Both content structuring and content-related workflows depend on the technical formats of the content. If content strategists is uninformed about the technical properties of content, they cannot assess workflows related to content, the independence of content from specific presentation formats, its usability on different or future platforms and the adequacy of any editorial tools to content structure. They are therefore not in a position to control the management of content from the point of view of the content, which is actually the most important. In practice, this leads to technicians or  controllers and business people taking over these functions, and then content inevitably does not play the first role in the design of the life cycle of online content.

## Platform knowledge and the productive development of content

A third aspect, perhaps the most important for content strategy, is related to the Web as a platform&mdash;in a double sense:
-to the Web as an open free platform based on Web technologies on the one hand - to the Web in the common understanding as a platform for all digital content on the other hand.

Content on the Web, as with all older technologies, is closely related to the technical format in which it lives and is consumed in real-world situations. Just as the material properties of books and magazines have consequences for the design of content, e.g. for its linear character and its subdivision into sections and chapters, the material (or maybe better: immaterial) properties of the web also have consequences for the design of content, e.g. for navigation, for its fitness for different mobile platforms and for the contents interaction with technical functions, e.g. in an online store. Much more than in traditional media, whose techniques have often hardly evolved over centuries, digital platforms are developing extremely fast and depending on hard and software factors. All digital content formats that have become current in recent years, from blogs to live video, were developed by technicians. Only if you have an understanding of these technical developments and their particular dynamics you can participate in their design or simply select the techniques that are important for a particular service or product.

On the Web in the strict (the web as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium) it is characteristic that content is in special measure user-friendly, because content can be freely reused and linked to independently from proprietary platforms and technologies. But just to understand  this openness and the restrictions&mdash;and sometimes also the advantages&mdash;of propretary silos you have to know the technical platform of the web. Who does not know how a link works on the web, can also not judge whether a tweet or a Facebook post is really the adequate form to publish a specific content, whether it would e.g. be better derived from a blogpost and republished on social media platforms. If you don't know that there is a difference between open web technologies and the proprietary technologies used e.g. for mobile apps on IOS and Android, you cannot judge whether content is better published primarily on the web or prepared for apps, or whether it makes sense to design it independently from both platforms. In other words: As a creative content developer, you need to understand the interdependencies between the content and the different technologies.




Black screens on which many small white, green, yellow or red characters flicker. Numbers, angle brackets, commas are displayed. For many, it is a big question mark what exactly programmers and software developers have in front of them when they are writing code. Most of the time it is shyness or perplexity that prevents one from asking more questions. Or one acts according to the motto: Don't saddle yourself with something you don't know what to do with anyway.

Yet the programming shortcuts in the background are the be-all and end-all of every website. Without programming, nothing works on the web. And even if people who publish texts and images on the internet rarely actually come into contact with the codes, for example the programming language HTML, it is worth taking a look at them, according one of first lectures of the course "Digital Publication Platforms".

### Exchange ideas with technical staff

After all, part of the job profile of a content strategist is to commission and accompany the development of content management systems, to design applications or at least to supervise them and adapt them for one's own use. Often it is just a matter of making small adjustments. Especially then, one should be able to exchange ideas with the technicians and know which vocabulary is best to use. After all, you want to be understood with your wishes and goals.</span>

At least that is the argument of Heinz Wittenbrink, long-time head of the</span> <span class="c8">[Master's programme in Content Strategy at the FH Joanneum](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fh-joanneum.at/content-strategie-und-digitale-kommunikation/master/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1613728613124000&usg=AOvVaw33LobYiTCE6jwxg_iBALvO)</span><span class="c4"> and currently a lecturer. In his lecture, he shows the most important basics of programming - and wants one thing above all: for the students to get to grips with it themselves. They are supposed to create a small website project themselves, which doesn't have to be so much about the content. But the website should contain what can be done with relatively little effort. Text, headlines, subtitles, pictures, captions, links to each other and links to external sites. A real structure. You can find plenty of suggestions on how best to get started on the web. But more on that later.

First, it is worth taking a look at Wittenbrink's curriculum vitae to understand how a content person can develop a passion for the web and publishing there. Wittenbrink started his early career in book publishing. As far as publishing on the internet is concerned, he is considered an early adopter. He experimented in this field as early as the 1990s and implemented his first projects. For example, in the conception of the encyclopaedic platform Wissen.de or in the development of a B2B portal in the field of electronic publishing for Bertelsmann.

<span class="c4">At that time, there were neither ready-made online editorial systems nor simple, easy-to-understand instructions on how to proceed. Wittenbrink probably had to learn the basics of programming in order to do justice to his tasks. And he obviously recognised the added value in it: that good things can come about when content creators can exchange ideas with technicians on an equal footing.</span>

### Useful guides


<span>Today, the web is full of guides that quickly teach you HTML. The page</span> <span class="c8">[develpoper.mozilla.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1613728613125000&usg=AOvVaw37LlTfkZI2KtndS3tznAjJ) </span><span class="c4">recommended by Wittenbrink shows how a typical HTML page and an HTML element is structured, what the head and metadata is about. It also shows how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.</span>

Why structuring the text is important is explained</span><span class="c8">[ on another page there](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1613728613125000&usg=AOvVaw0_vWrm25SouWM35d6pgpud)</span><span class="c4">: Users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly to find relevant content, often just reading the headings, to begin with. If they can't see anything useful within a few seconds, they'll likely get frustrated and go somewhere else.</span>

### Important for search engines

The role of search engines also weighs heavily and must be taken into account when coding HTML: Search engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search rankings. Without headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

German-language sources for self-study of the code also exist. The aim of [selfhtml.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.selfhtml.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1613728613126000&usg=AOvVaw18mmtjlnX2vqJuTQKvegvR)</span> is to provide documentation on HTML and related technologies. It is intended to introduce beginners to the creation of websites in accordance with the current state of the art, but also to serve as a reliable reference work for advanced users and professionals. Clearly arranged in a wiki, those interested will find everything they are looking for on HTML. Hardly any question remains unanswered. You can work your way from one HTML term to the next via numerous links.</span>

<span>Very basic in design, but no less in-depth in content, is the site</span> <span class="c8">[html.spec.whatwg.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1613728613127000&usg=AOvVaw3vpBLkLjF5snEf1W5acO58)</span><span class="c4">, which is constantly updated.</span>

<span class="c4">And when you're through with the instructions? Then hopefully the following sentence by Wittenbrink applies: "You have to be able to understand the core of HTML”.Then, he says, it is "no witchcraft" to control what may be the responsibility of other members of an organisation or company - to handle the technical stuff in the background. Because, as is often the case, you can't become an expert in everything. But a little control is always helpful and being able to have a say doesn't hurt anyway.</span>
