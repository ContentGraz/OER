## Relevance

Content audits are one of the most important parts of a content strategist's work. They are always related to a qualitive goal: Can the existing content achieve what it should achieve? But before you can analyze and assess your content you must find out what content you have - a difficult task in many cases. A content inventory gives a structured overview of the content published or created by an organization. To set up a content inventory is one of the first skills a beginning content strategist must acquire.

## Description



### One Can Not [#](#one-can-not)

One cannot talk about _Content Audits_ without mentioning _Content Inventories_, as the basis of every Content Audit is a profound Content Inventory. As part of [Paula Lands](https://www.fh-joanneum.at/en/university/person/paula-ladenburg-land/) course “Content Audits”, #COS students were being taught about the importance and characteristics of Content Inventories.

To create an effective content strategy, it is essential to be aware of the current state. Content Audit is a study to realise where content is at the moment and potential improvement areas for the future. Both website visitors and organisations do have a goal through the website, content audit helps enabling and aligning those goals across content, organisation and the user.

Content Audit is a qualitative judgement of the content and its functionality. Audit is basically measuring the quality of content towards desired actions. In this article we guide you through the preparation for content audit, which is the "**content inventory"** and few more things those needed to be clarified before having a content audit .

Before we get started, let’s clear up some main terms first:  

### What is meant by content? [#](#what-is-meant-by-content)

A piece of content is the information that is directed towards a customer or user. Content can appear and be published in many forms, such as headline, text body, video, images and through different channels. In our class we were digging deeper into digital content, presented on a Website.  

### What is an inventory? [#](#what-is-an-inventory)

You might be familiar with the term _inventory_ as you know that every supermarket needs to conduct it and that this is done either at a quarterly period or at the end of the year. At a specific time, supermarkets need to check on which products (WHAT) are located within their storage (WHERE) and further on to to which extent (HOW MANY) and what kind of quality.  

### What is a content inventory? [#](#what-is-a-content-inventory)

So if you think of your website as a supermarket, then for a Content Inventory you would need to look at every page and every piece of content that is found on your website, in order to later on qualify how good it is, determine gaps, detect room for improvement et cetera.  

A content inventory is done as a preparation for a content audit, when:

*   Content improvement is needed
*   Getting ready for content migration
*   Getting ready to enter new market
*   Maintenance and optimisation is needed
*   To immerse yourself with business

Before starting a content audit following questions should be asked to define the concept of the project.  

1.  Why is a content audit happening?
2.  What are the organisational objectives?
3.  How to measure the success of the audit?  

    To be able to understand business goals followings can be done:  

    1.  Stakeholder Analysis; identify everyone contributes to content including cross functional teams.
    2.  Assigning measurable metrics to goals.
    3.  Prioritise musts and shoulds.
    4.  List of long term and short term goals.
4.  Who does the organisation serve?
5.  What does a visitor/user need to find on a website?
6.  How to know website visitors find what they need?  

    To be able to understand users/visitor’s goals followings can be done:  

    1.  User Research
    2.  User Analytics
    3.  User Feedback
    4.  Personas User Flows
    5.  Customer Journeys

Above questions help to identify users and the organisation. Additionally an auditor should be aware of the:  

*   Resources and Budget
*   Long term content strategy and planning
*   Clear understanding of what an auditor will work with  

Answering those questions are considered as the “define” section, afterwards “assess” section starts which consist of content inventory and audit.  

### How is a content inventory done? [#](#how-is-a-content-inventory-done)

To be able to do a comprehensive and full audit, a content inventory should be done which is quantitative analyses of all pages of the website. There are 2 ways to create an inventory:

*   **Manual:** it creates a detailed perception about the site on auditors' mind as the auditor manually gets into each page on the site. It also allows the auditor to realise patterns on the site. However as the webpage grows, manual ways to create inventory becomes tedious and time-consuming. However, to get a sense of the website and the content, it is not always necessary to audit every single page. Depending on what goals are fixed for the audit and which purpose one aimes, the amount of pages being audited can vary.

*   **Automated:** it is fetching all pages on a webpage by a tool. This way is fast and generally fetches everything on the website and thus works very detailed and precisely. However, the automated way only gathers data, unlikely manual work, it doesn't create insights and it is not hands-on. In addition, automation will display information, but in an unstructured way. The structure has to be added manually after all.<u>Potential tools:</u> CAT (content-insight.com), Screaming Frog and URL Profiler.

### How should a content inventory be structured?

Content inventory should contain: URL, file type, media including videos and images, meta data, Word Count and H1 tag text. If a tool/software is used to create inventory, it is suggested to start from the home page to tidy up the inventory and follow the navigational structure. It is essential to put ID to each URL to not get confused in the future and sort the content easily.

### Next steps – what happens after the inventory? [#](#next-steps-what-happens-after-the-inventory)

After having the content inventory, an auditor basically has the list of what s/he needs to audit. Voilà: the audit can start as you completed your inventory.

## Content inventories and audit types

Every audit needs some basic informations in the inventory. But which type of audit you have chosen is important for additional information that has to be gathered over the whole range of your content (as we have said either by collecting it for every single piece or by analyzing a representative sample).

Just a brief information for you to consider different types of content audits; qualitative (editorial) , competitive (best practices), brand, content performance, structural (functional), global, audience and social audit. This article will mainly focus on Qualitative Audit, Competitive Audit as well as Quantitative Analyses (Content Inventory).

*   **Qualitative Audit** is analysing the effectiveness of content and how it performs for desired actions.
*   **Competitive Audit** is an audit type focused on best practices in the market by comparing audience, type and quantity of content, language format including tone and voice, community features, frequency of publication, overall impression and any other differentiating features across organisations.
*   The **Brand Audit** mainly evaluates terminology, tone and voice, imagery and messaging. The main purpose is to evaluate how content delivers brand message and represents the organisation.
*   **Content Performance Audit** uses analytics data, site metrics, search data and customer feedback to see how content is performing towards quantitative business objectives.
*   The **audience audit** elaborates how content meets with the users needs by focusing on user types, needs, tasks, flows, customer journey map, and gap analyses.
*   The **structural (functional)** audit focuses on User Interface and Experience. It identifies content elements, interactions, navigational models, templates and content types.
*   The **global audit** analyse site for localisation efforts including language support, breadth of translation, cultural relevance, navigational model, imagery, design consistency, regional and local content and localised meta content.
