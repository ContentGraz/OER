What exactly is strategy? Why do we need it? How do we create a successful business strategy? And why do some say strategy is dead?
Dieter Rappold explained at the beginning of his course [Business Strategy for Digital Markets][bs], why and how business strategy has totally changed in the digital space. The new landscapes of digital business strategy are the playground for relevant content strategies.


## Relevance

Content strategy and business strategy are mutually dependent. Content strategies support business strategies, business in the digital space requires a strategic approach to all facets of content. To understand the operating space of their discipline content strategists need to understand what business strategy means today. Dieter Rappold explained it with the perspective of a reflecting digital entrepreneur.

## Description

Let’s talk about business. Have you ever asked yourself “Why the hack are they so damn successful?!” Here’s the answer: Cause they got a great strategy - and are even better at executing. Oh, wait, let me just add this by the way: Strategy is dead. But without a strategy no business will be successful. Okay, before you get even more confused let’s get started!

### What is a strategy?

To answer this question, set your clock back. Back to the old greek. Cause this is where the word “strategy” finds its origin. In warfare, where your goal was to survive. It means “the art to lead an army” cause this was the way to reach that goal. Somehow it is still slightly the same: “Strategy is the planned sustainable behavior of an organization to reach its goals.” Okay, let’s take this step by step.

The key formula is: Strategy = goal + path.

First you need a goal. A big business target you want to reach. Without a goal everyone understands, a strategy can not exist. Then you craft your strategy. Cause strategy is the path to reach this specific goal.

But: Strategy is not something theoretical written on a nice PowerPoint. That won't make your business successful. It won’t even make it survive. Because: Execution is key! Execution rules! The plan itself is super important but following that plan is the key. You will not survive with no strategy but only if you’re good at executing your strategy you will be successful.

### "Strategy is dead": Strategy in a hypertransparent world

You perform your business in a paradox situation. Your business won’t survive without a well executed strategy. Nevertheless strategy is dead. Why? Because we live in times of *hyper-transparency*. Not long ago businesses were able to do projects with large organizations where they learned important insights earlier than others and were able to use that early knowledge as an advantage as part of their strategy.

But today we live in hyper-transparency. Everybody knows about everything. And even the most powerful governments in the world can not keep things to themselves. Just remember Wikileaks. Or how fast media and especially social media is. You can not expect to know things others do not know. You do not have that advantage anymore.

So, do not expect to have the one and only strategy no one knows about. Those times have passed. All businesses have kind of the same strategy. And that is why strategy is dead. But remember: Execution is key.

### Why do we need a strategy? Can’t we just wing it? #

The short answer is: No, you can’t just improvise it.

You did not specifically ask, but here is the longer answer anyway:

Strategy helps us to find the best way possible to get from A to B. It answers basic, but essential questions like “Why do we do what we do?” “What do we do?” “When do we do it?” and “Where do we do it?”.

Without strategy, we would not have a clear picture of everything that goes on in our company, nor would we have a foundation which we could reflect and base our decisions from.

A strategic framework not only helps with making decisions, but also serves as a guideline for the next actions that need to be taken. Without this quintessential foundation, our company would not work as one unit, resulting in little profits and success.

To make it even more clear let us look at this question: What would be the opposite of a strategic behavior? Well, of course *opportunistic behavior*. By this is meant that you have a goal and a plan how to reach that goal, but on your way you just stop and lose your strategic focus when an opportunity comes along. Sometimes those opportunities are really tempting, for example better cash flow or better marges. But they do not serve your big goal if they do not fit in with your strategy and do have the potential to ruin everything - worst case.

### How do we create a business strategy? Isn’t that, like, super hard to do? #

So far, we have talked about what strategy exactly is, what hypertransparency means and what we need strategy for. But how do we actually create a goal-oriented business strategy?

Three questions that seem simple at first glance, are essential:

Why? What? How?

But before we answer these existential questions, let us look at the very beginning of the strategy process - the review. First and foremost, it is essential that a company reflects on itself from the ground up, analyzes its competitors and thus derives best practices.

By looking back at where a company comes from, an outlook should then be defined by the three points

* Motives,
* Output and
* Procedure.

Tip: What you should pay special attention to when creating a business strategy is: Keep it simple. Reduce complexity. Separate the relevant from the irrelevant so as not to lose sight of the focus and the goal.

And at this point we return to the three questions mentioned at the beginning.

* Why? - What is our motivation and our mission?
* What do we want to achieve?
* How do we reach our goals? Which measures do we need to take?

If this seems too abstract, here is an example from the real world:

Brand: Ferrari (sports-car manufacturer)

* Why (Motives): To be the best sports car manufacturer on the planet, representing Italy and inspiring people from all over the world
* What (Output): To be the most successful and best-known car manufacturer in motor sports, to dominate Formula 1 and produce top-class sports cars
* How: To embody and promote the greatest possible commitment to motor sports, Italian values and traditions within the company and to prioritize quality.

It is crucial that all company employees know the answers to these questions, share the same view and work towards the same goal.
“A business strategy is a set of guiding principles that, when communicated and adopted in the organization, generates a desired pattern of decision making.”

These statements are obviously not so easy to verify. Therefore, strategic goals should be defined and aimed for, which concretize the vision of the company and make it measurable.

### SMART Goals and KPIs

Pull out your notepads (or rather your app on your smartphone where you enter all your notes and never look at them again), because here comes another tip:
Strategic goals have to be SMART. Specific, measurable, attractive, realistic und time phased.

To measure our SMART goals for success, we need to define individual KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). In our example with Ferrari, these could be world championship titles in Formula 1 or increasing market share in the sports car sector by x%.

With this newly gained knowledge, the way to world domination (Edit: a successful business strategy) should be paved.

Just kidding, there is so much more to know about successfully running a business. Different leadership types for example. Or did you already hear about the principle of Unbundling?

## Questions and Answers

Did you just think “Okay, I get that. But isn’t one of the most important things for entrepreneurs to identify opportunities and go for them?”. Great objection! You’re absolutely right! So, how to deal with that paradox? Well, the main question rather is: How can you integrate those fantastic opportunities that come along in your strategy? The answer is simple: Use your brain, human. Watch out. Stay flexible. But: Follow your strategy! Always keep in mind and ask yourself “Is this opportunity on my strategic path or do I have to change my strategy path to integrate that opportunity?”

## Literature recommendations

The literature on the subject of strategy is hardly manageable. One of the most important authors is Harry Mintzberg, to whom the famous [5Ps for strategy][5ps-for_strategy] go back: plan, ploy. pattern, position and perspective. In the content strategy community, Kristina Halvorson, among others, has addressed the concept of strategy and the relationships between strategy and content strategy, e.g., in [What Is Strategy (and Why Should You Care)?][halvorson-on-strategy]. There is also a lot of literature about *hypertransparency* in the meantime; you can find some titles (except in the bibliography below) in the [COS-Bibliography][hyper-transparency-bibio].
