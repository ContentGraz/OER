STONKS! Just like the woman in this licence-free picture we found on the internet, a content strategist must convince businesses that a change in strategy will bring an increase of revenue and other desirable things. The only difference is, that a content strategist will need more than a chart with an arrow pointing upwards.

What is a *content strategist*? In practice and in literature this role is understood in many different and often conflicting ways. In her introductory lecture, [Rahel Bailie][rahelbailie] explained, why she understands content strategists as business consultants specialized in content.

“Developing relationships, delivering results.” – these are the core missions of a consultant. But it’s about more than just the relationship between the consultant and the business. It’s about identifying connections between the business’ strengths, weaknesses and goals to achieve a desired future with the help of the consultant’s expertise. And that’s also the core mission of a content strategist. Content strategy means combining a business’ lifecycles concerning customers, products and content. These lifecycles and their sub-activities are interdependent, whereby decision making is just successful by considering one another. It’s about planning acquisition activities such as content marketing, social media marketing or direct marketing campaigns to attract new customers. It’s about maintaining customers by using content for customer support, training and knowledge base. And it’s about the management and governance of content.

All in all, Content Strategy can be seen as the Umbrella Strategy that includes every internal and external factor, which affects the business.
Meeting needs and solving problems #

A content strategist acts as a consultant regarding content, who analyses the needs of the business, users and operational team as well as the governance and budget in the first step. This is the most important part to plan further steps. After that, content is collected, managed and delivered, which are the operational parts that carry out the plan and strategy.

To put it in a nutshell, a content strategist is planning the doing in order to meet a business need or solve a business problem. He/she is designing a repeatable system that supports content operations.
Content as a business benefit #

Companies that see dealing with content as a necessary evil are usually not aware of the benefits that come with a good content strategy. Therefore, a content strategist has to point out business benefits that are enhanced by dealing with content in a proper way. Such benefits would be the expansion into new markets through personalized content, building brand trust with more accurate, trustworthy content, managing risks with a better audit trail or obviously increasing revenue. In order to make a client understand the whole spectrum of possibilities that come with a good content strategy, he/she has to realize that content is more than just a text on a website, it’s everything from design to pictures to metadata and so on. Until they get that state of mind, there’s a lot of consulting and guiding to be done.
A four-step methodology to a successful content strategy #

Every project starts with a dialogue between a business and the content strategist. More precisely, it starts with the question “What are you doing right now?” This marks the beginning of the discovery-part, the first phase of a four-step methodology towards a successful content strategy. The goal is to determine a status quo and see, where you have to put your finger on in order to achieve future goals. The second part is about analyzing the gap between your current state and the goal you want to achieve. A gap analysis is about defining what needs to be done in order to reach the future state. Part three is all about creating recommendations by using the so called “MoSCoW” model, where you basically define the musts, should, coulds and woulds of your strategy. As soon as that is done, the fourth and last part is in line: creating a road map that guides the client from the current state to the future one. Having these steps in mind and putting it into practice is a big help to work more structured and purposeful.
Deliverables and Project Phases #

There are different types of projects a content strategist can be tasked to complete. These vary in complexity and can be grouped into:

    Core projects: Usually have to do with existing markets and processes. They are single lnguge projects deployed on few channels and have no technical requirements.
    Complex projects: These involve multiple markets and languages, new channels and delivery needs, but do not require new technology.
    Technical projects: These might involve migrations, new feature or system implementations or add-ons to the other forms of project.

Similarly, there are a number of different deliverables. Deliverables can be the report at the end of the project or a number of different assets that are a proof of the work done. The value is not in the deliverables (contrary to common interpretations), but in the work done to create them. Deliverables can be grouped in macro-categories and change as the project shifts from one phase to another. These categories are:

    Research: Examples of these are marketing research, customer journey, discovery interviews, …
    Analysis: Examples of these can be content briefs, requirement matrix, content inventory, …
    Design: Content matrix, metadata strategy, taxonomy, localization strategy, …
    Build: Content types, domain models, editorial style guides, …

The first two relate to the discovery, gap analysis, recommendation and roadmap pahases, while the design and build categories have to do more with the operational aspects of the project, when the strategy is being implemented. While the number of potential deliverables can be vast, not all deliverables are always needed for every project, though there are a number of core ones that are generally needed.
Product content and complexity #

When thinking about a website, most people will think about the marketing content, however this is just a small proportion of the overall content on the website. Most of the content can be defined as product content. These might be warranty information, terms and agreements, user manuals, tutorials, or any other content that is not related to marketing. This can apply to physical products, services, or hybrid versions, such as a subscription model, and when working on a content strategy it is necessary to keep this distinction into account and address both types of content. Another aspect that adds complexity to a project and must be accounted for, are the different channels a product is pushed on, and how each one might need specific content. UX writing is different from chatbot writing or from technical writing. It is necessary to evaluate what different forms of content are needed for a given project.
My home is my content strategy #

A content strategy is only useful when it is implemented. To create a content strategy is to design a repeatable system, this system is meant to support content operations in their deployment and iterations and should keep into account the main themes of operational models which generally consist in reducing inefficiencies, automating processes, enabling scaling up, monitoring and creating insights, and iterating again (explicit themes) and improving collaboration, automation, innovation and reducing risk (implicit themes). A useful metaphor for a content strategy is the construction of a home. Before the house can be lived in and “operated”, it needs to be built, and before that it must be planned and designed.

Content strategy deployment works in a similar way, with the strategy phase taking anywhere between 3-12 months, the implementation phase 6-24 months, and the operations phase many years. These phases closely match the planning, building and living phases of a house.
The bridge between content operation and content management #

Content Operations is a set of principles that results in methodologies intended to optimise production of content, and allow organisations to scale their operations, while ensuring high quality in a continuous delivery pipeline, to allow for the leveraging of content as business assets to meet intended goals. To make this possible a series of elements are needed. These are:

    Categorization
    Quality management
    Governance
    Change management
    Internal comms
    Monitoring and analytics

Content Operations influence and, in turn, are dependent on content management. Content management is comprised of several different topics, from domain models to content flows and types, to accessibility and inclusivity. The purpose of these topics is to help map the different content types and domains that the project needs, so that content can be optimized to be used across different channels and types while still being true to the context it is meant for. Content management includes the creation of content models and flows, to ensure that different forms of content can be aggregated and combined in a way that enables automated content processing, meets user needs and expectations and allows predictable delivery of content in sophisticated ways.

Let's be honest: Were you aware of how important the role of a consultant is for a content strategist? If not, you're like so many who are just venturing into the field of content strategy. And if this article did not reveal anything new for you, you are either an experienced content strategist, a lecturer at the FH Joanneum Graz or simply a genius. In this case, however, it is certainly never wrong to recall the content of this article from time to time.
