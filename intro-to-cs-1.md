# The content strategist as a business consultant

28 October 2020


**Topic:** Roles of content strategists

---

**Teaser:**  What is a *content strategist*? In practice and literature, this role is understood in many different and often conflicting ways. In her introductory lecture, [Rahel Bailie][rahelbailie] explained, why she understands content strategists as business consultants specialized in content.

**Context:** The tasks of content strategists are not as clearly defined as those of other professions and roles in digital business. This makes it difficult for freelance content strategists to describe what services they provide, and it makes content strategists who work in-house the go-to girl for everything on content-related tasks that no one else wants to play. To be a successful in the profession, it's important to clearly define the role of the content strategist. Rahel Bailie therefore clearly distinguished the role of content strategists from other roles at the very beginning of her introduction to content strategy, comparing it to a similar role, that of business consultant.

STONKS! Just like the woman in this licence-free picture we found on the internet, a content strategist must convince business that a change in strategy will bring an increase in revenue and other desirable things. The only difference is, that a content strategist will need more than a chart with an arrow pointing upwards.

**Description:**

“Developing relationships, delivering results.” – these are the core missions of a consultant. But it’s about more than just the relationship between the consultant and the business. It’s about identifying connections between the business’ strengths, weaknesses and goals to achieve the desired future with the help of the consultant’s expertise. And that’s also the core mission of a content strategist. Content strategy means combining a business’ lifecycles concerning customers, products and content. These lifecycles and their sub-activities are interdependent, whereby decision making is just successful by considering one another. It’s about planning acquisition activities such as content marketing, social media marketing or direct marketing campaigns to attract new clients. It’s about maintaining clients by using content for customer support, training and knowledge base. And it’s about the management and governance of content.

All in all, Content Strategy can be seen as the umbrella strategy that includes every internal and external factor, which affects the business.

## Meeting needs and solving problems.

A content strategist acts as a consultant regarding content, who analyses the needs of the business, users and operational team as well as the governance and budget in the first step. This is the main part to plan further steps. After that, content is collected, managed and delivered, which are the operative parts that carry out the plan and strategy.

To put it in a nutshell, a content strategist is planning the doing to meet a business need or solve a business problem. He/she is designing a repeatable system that supports content operations.

## Content as a business benefit

Companies that see dealing with content as a necessary evil are usually not aware of the benefits that come with a good content strategy. Therefore, a content strategist has to point out business benefits that are enhanced by dealing with content appropriately. Such benefits would be the expansion into new markets through personalized content, building brand trust with more accurate, trustworthy content, managing risks with a better audit trail or increasing revenue. To make a client understand the whole spectrum of possibilities that come with a sound content strategy, he/she has to realize that content is more than just a text on a website, it’s everything from design to pictures to metadata and so on. Until they get that state of mind, there are a lot of consulting and guiding to be done.

# A four-step methodology to a successful content strategy

Every project starts with a dialogue between business and the content strategist. More precisely, it starts with the question “What are you doing now now?” This marks the start of the discovery-part, the first phase of a four-step methodology towards a successful content strategy. The goal is to determine a status quo and see, where you have to put your finger on to achieve future goals. The second part is about analyzing the gap between your current state and the goal you wish to achieve. A gap analysis is about defining what remains to be done to reach the future state. Part three is all about creating recommendations by using the so-called “MoSCoW” model, where you define the musts, shoulds, coulds and woulds of your strategy. As soon as that is done, the fourth and last part is in line: Creating a road map that guides the client from the current state to the future one. Having these steps in mind and putting it in practice is a big help to work in  more structured and purposeful way.

# Deliverables and Project Phases 

There are diverse types of projects a content strategist can be tasked to complete. These vary in complexity and can be grouped into:

* Core Projects: Usually have to do with existing markets and processes. They are single language projects deployed on a few channels and have no technical requirements.
* Complex Projects: These involve multiple markets and languages, new channels and delivery needs, but do not require new technology.
* Technical Projects: These might involve migrations, new feature or system implementations or add-ons to the other forms of project.

Similarly, there are several distinct deliverables. Deliverables can be the report at the end of the project or some different assets that are proof of the work done. The value is not in the deliverables (contrary to common interpretations) but in the work done in order to create them. Deliverables can be grouped in macro-categories and change as the project shifts from one phase to another. These categories are:

* Research: Examples of these are marketing research, customer journey, discovery interviews, …
* Analysis: Examples of these can be content briefs, requirement matrix, content inventory, …
* Design: Content matrix, metadata strategy, taxonomy, localization strategy, …
* Build: Content types, domain models, editorial style guides, …

The first two relate to the discovery, gap analysis, recommendation and roadmap phases, while the design and build categories have to do more with the operational aspects of the project, when the strategy is applied. While the number of potential deliverables can be immeasurable, not all deliverables are always needed for every project, though several core ones are generally needed.

## Product content and complexity

When thinking about a website, most people will think about the marketing content, however, this is just a small proportion of the overall content of the website. Most of the content can be described as product content. These might be warranty information, terms and agreements, user manuals, tutorials, or any other content that is not related to marketing. This can apply to physical products, services, or hybrid versions, such as a subscription model, and when working on a content strategy it is necessary in order to keep this distinction into account and address both types of content. Another aspect that adds complexity to a project and must be accounted for, is the different channels a product is pushed on, and how each one might need specific content. UX writing is different from chat bot writing or technical writing. It is necessary to evaluate what diverse forms of content are needed for a given project.

## My home is my content strategy 

A content strategy is only useful when it is implemented. To create a content strategy is to design a repeatable system, this system is meant to support content operations in their deployment and iterations and should keep into account the main themes of operational models which generally consist in reducing inefficiencies, automating processes, enabling scaling up, monitoring and creating insights, and iterating again (explicit themes) and improving collaboration, automation, innovation and reducing risk (implicit themes). A useful metaphor for a content strategy is the construction of a home. Before the house can be lived in and “operated”, it has to be built, and before that, it must be planned and designed.

Content strategy deployment works similarly, with the strategy phase taking anywhere between 3-12 months, the implementation phase 6-24 months, and the operations phase many years. These phases closely match the planning, building and living phases of a house.

## The bridge between content operation and content management 

Content Operations is a set of principles that results in methodologies intended to optimise production of content, and allow organisations to scale their operations, while ensuring high quality in a continuous delivery pipeline, to allow for the leveraging of content as business assets to meet intended goals. To make this possible a series of elements is needed. These are:

* Categorization
* Quality management
* Governance
* Change management
* Internal comms
* Monitoring and analytics

Content Operations influence and, in turn, are dependent on content management. Content management is comprised of several different topics, from domain models to content flows and types, to accessibility and inclusive design. The purpose of these topics is to help map the different content types and domains that the project needs, so that content can be optimized to be used across different channels and types while still being true to the context it is meant for. Content management includes the creation of content models and flows, to ensure that different forms of content can be aggregated and combined in a way that enables automated content processing, meets user needs and expectations and allows predictable delivery of content in sophisticated ways.

Let's be honest: Were you aware of how crucial the role of a consultant is for a content strategist? If not, you're like so many who are just venturing into the field of content strategy. And if this article did not reveal anything new for you, you are either an experienced content strategist, a lecturer at the FH Joanneum Graz or simply a genius. In this case, however, it is certainly never wrong to recall the content of this article from time to time.
