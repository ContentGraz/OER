## Teaser

What is a *content strategist*? In practice and literature, this role is understood in many different and often conflicting ways. In her introductory lecture, [Rahel Bailie][rahelbailie] explained, why she understands content strategists as business consultants specialized in content.

## Relevance

The tasks of content strategists are not as clearly defined as those of other professions and roles in digital business. This makes it difficult for freelance content strategists to describe what services they provide, and it makes content strategists who work in-house the go-to girl for everything on content-related tasks that no one else wants to play. To be a successful in the profession, it's important to clearly define the role of the content strategist. Rahel Bailie therefore clearly distinguished the role of content strategists from other roles at the very beginning of her introduction to content strategy, comparing it to a similar role, that of business consultant.

**Caption:**
STONKS! Just like the woman in this licence-free picture we found on the internet, a content strategist must convince business that a change in strategy will bring an increase in revenue and other desirable things. The only difference is, that a content strategist will need more than a chart with an arrow pointing upwards.

## Description

The consultant's main task consists in identifying connections between a business’ strengths, weaknesses and goals in order to achieve the desired future. "The point is that business consultants are supposed to improve businesses: they are not hired to maintain the status quo but to change it."[^1] The core mission of a content strategist is not different. Content strategists need an holistic view on a business’ core processes in order to identify the contributions of content to achieve business goals. The   lifecycles of a business's customers, products and content and their sub-activities are interdependent. Decision making is only successful if the dependencies are taken into account. The business processes in the field of content are often similar to the business processes in other fields and they support those processes. Content plays an important role for *acquisition activities* such as content marketing, social media marketing or direct marketing campaigns to attract new clients. Content has essential functions in *maintaining clients* via customer support, training and knowledge bases. The *management and governance* of content is not only essantial to secure effectiveness and efficiency of its production and administration but also for defining key charakteristics of a business for external and internal stakeholders.

All in all, Content Strategy can be seen as the umbrella strategy that includes every internal and external factor, which affects the business via the role content plays for it.

### Meeting needs and solving problems.

In order to fulfil the role of a consultant regarding content a content strategist analyses the needs of the business, users and operational team as well as the governance and budget in the first step. This is the main prerequisite for planning further steps. After the planning, content is collected, managed and delivered, which are the operative parts that carry out the plan and strategy.To put it in a nutshell, a content strategist is designing a repeatable system that supports content operations.

### Content as a business benefit

Companies that see dealing with content as a necessary evil are usually not aware of the benefits that come with a good content strategy. Therefore, a content strategist has to point out business benefits that are achieved by dealing with content appropriately. Such benefits would be the expansion into new markets through personalized content, building brand trust with more accurate, trustworthy content, managing risks with a better audit trail or increasing revenue. A client will understand the whole spectrum of possibilities that come with a sound content strategy only if he/she realizes that content is more than just text on a website. Everything transmitting a message is content &ndash; from design over pictures to metadata. Much of a content strategist's consulting work has this state of mind as its goal &ndash; and an inherent difficulty is that the client often doesn't grasp the point of the content strategist's activity until the strategist has achieved her/his goal.

### A four-step methodology for a successful content strategy

Every content strategy project starts with a dialogue &ndash; more precisely, with the content strategist's question: “What are you doing now?” The question marks the start of the *discovery-part*, the first phase of a four-step methodology leading towards a successful content strategy. The goal is to describe the status quo and to see, where you have to put your finger on to achieve future goals. The second part is about analyzing the gap between your current state and the goal you wish to achieve. A *gap analysis* is serving to  precisely define what remains to be done to reach the future state. Part three is all about *creating recommendations* &ndash; e.g. by using the so-called “MoSCoW” model[^2], where you define the musts, shoulds, coulds and woulds of your strategy. The fourth and last part is a logical consequence of part 3: Creating a *road map that guides the client from the current state to the future one*. Using this road map to guide your content strategy practise is a proven help to a assure that you work in a structured and purposeful way.

### Deliverables and Project Phases

There are diverse types of projects a content strategist can be asked to complete. These vary in complexity and can be grouped into:

* Core Projects: Usually they have to do with existing markets and processes. They are single language projects deployed on a few channels and have no technical requirements.
* Complex Projects: These involve multiple markets and languages, new channels and delivery needs, but do not require new technology.
* Technical Projects: These might involve migrations, new feature or system implementations or add-ons to the other forms of project.

Like the goals the deliveries of content strategy projects con vary a lot. The report at the end of the project can as well a core deliverable as some newly crated assets which are proof of the work done. Contrary to common interpretation the value resides not in the deliverables (c) but in the work done in order to create them. Deliverables can be grouped in macro-categories and may change as the project transits from one phase to another. These categories are:

* Research: Examples are marketing research papers, customer journey diagrams, discovery interviews, …
* Analysis: Examples are content briefs, requirement matrices, content inventories, …
* Design: Content matrices, metadata strategies, taxonomies, localization strategirs, …
* Build: Content types, domain models, editorial style guides, …

The first two groups of deliveries are connected to the operational aspects of the project, when the strategy is applied. While the number of potential deliverables can be immeasurable, most projects require only a small set of deliverables. Some core deliverables are essential for nearly every content strategy project. are always needed,

### Product content and complexity

When thinking about a website, most people will think about the marketing content, however, this is just a small proportion of the overall content of the website. Most of the content can be described as product content. These might be warranty information, terms and agreements, user manuals, tutorials, or any other content that is not related to marketing. This content can belong to physical as well es to hybrid and digital products and services, e.g. software as service. , or hybrid versions, such as a subscription model, and when working on a content strategy it is necessary in order to keep this distinction into account and address both types of content. Another aspect that adds complexity to a project and must be accounted for, is the different channels a product is pushed on, and how each one might need specific content. UX writing is different from chat bot writing or technical writing. It is necessary to evaluate what diverse forms of content are needed for a given project.

### My home is my content strategy

A content strategy is only useful when it is implemented. To create a content strategy is to design a repeatable system, this system is meant to support content operations in their deployment and iterations and should keep into account the main themes of operational models which generally consist in reducing inefficiencies, automating processes, enabling scaling up, monitoring and creating insights, and iterating again (explicit themes) and improving collaboration, automation, innovation and reducing risk (implicit themes). A useful metaphor for a content strategy is the construction of a home. Before the house can be lived in and “operated”, it has to be built, and before that, it must be planned and designed.

Content strategy deployment works similarly, with the strategy phase taking usually between 3-12 months, the implementation phase 6-24 months, and the operations phase many years. These phases closely match the planning, building and living phases of a house.

### Content operations: The bridge between content strategy and content management

Content operations is a set of principles that results in methodologies intended to optimise production of content, and allow organisations to scale their operations, while ensuring high quality in a continuous delivery pipeline, to allow for the leveraging of content as business assets to meet intended goals. To make this possible a series of elements is needed. These are:

* Categorization
* Quality management
* Governance
* Change management
* Internal comms
* Monitoring and analytics

Content Operations influence and, in turn, are dependent on content management. Content management is comprised of several different topics, from domain models to content flows and types, to accessibility and inclusive design. The purpose of these topics is to help map the different content types and domains that the project needs, so that content can be optimized to be used across different channels and types while still being true to the context it is meant for. Content management includes the creation of content models and flows, to ensure that different forms of content can be aggregated and combined in a way that enables automated content processing, meets user needs and expectations and allows predictable delivery of content in sophisticated ways.

Let's be honest: Were you aware of how crucial the role of a consultant is for a content strategist? If not, you're like so many who are just venturing into the field of content strategy. And if this article did not reveal anything new for you, you are either an experienced content strategist, a lecturer at the FH Joanneum Graz or simply a genius. In this case, however, it is certainly never wrong to recall the content of this article from time to time.
