<div class="leading-relaxed mb-8 italic text-xl">A brand-driven content strategy helps an organization to figure out its values and differentiators. It shapes the path for all future content decisions. Boston-based content strategist Margot Bloomstein taught her core principles in solving business challenges with content strategy. In her inimitable, always positive manner, she takes the students by the hand and teaches 'along the way' and with a lot of practical content from the world of content strategy.</div>

Towards the end of the 90ies the general approach of web-design was more user focused. But if an organization operates only on user needs their business values get lost and their brand becomes generic. The course “Brand Values & Message Architecture” focuses on the role and the needs of brands and how to solve their challenges with content strategy. The lecturer Margot Bloomstein is a passionate content strategist with more than 20 years of experience in the field. Her 5-step-process is the lens of how she looks at content strategy. “It is not the only one, but it is one right way”, Bloomstein explains.

Our Brand-Value lectures were built along Bloomstein’s 5-step process (as shown in the image above) to create a brand-driven content strategy. In this article 3 of those 5 steps are being described in detail.

#### So - what is a message architecture? [#](#so-what-is-a-message-architecture)

The message architecture is the core principle of a content strategy. It helps an organization to define what is important and valuable. A message architecture is not the brands value itself, but a guide for external communication. It sets the direction of how an organization should communicate with its audience to get its message across. “A message architecture is a hierarchy of communication goals; as a hierarchy, they're attributes that appear in order of priority, typically in an outline.” (Bloomstein, 2012, S.20) Since all businesses and organizations are dealing with constraints, such as limited time or budget, the message architecture represents the most important communication goals in a prioritized order.

#### Message architecture in practice [#](#message-architecture-in-practice)

Besides the theoretical input, Bloomstein showcased many real-life examples of how message architecture works in practice. She sparked up a discussion by asking which of these drinks contain the most caffeine:

None of the students in class would have guessed the correct answer: **Starbucks coffee**. Why? Bloomstein explains that the messaging shapes the character of a brand and how it is being perceived. While Starbucks speaks more to professionals in suits, Red Bull focuses on the athlete type of consumer. The latter makes you believe that the drink gives you more energy, although that is in fact not true.

#### How to define a message architecture: introduction to the card sorting exercise [#](#how-to-define-a-message-architecture-introduction-to-the-card-sorting-exercise)

Card sorting is an exercise where people assign various attributes to 3 different columns:

*   who we are not

*   who we are

*   who we’d like to be

Each attribute is printed on a paper card. After all, cards are being assigned, the pile of cards in the who-we-are-not-column gets tossed away. The participants now have to decide what values (attributes) they want to leave behind when moving forward. That means all attributes they want to hang on to, go into the pile of who we’d like to be. In the last step, the participants have to group similar attributes in word clouds and prioritize those clouds. The result is a hierarchy of attributes that represent an organization's communication goals.

The physical interaction with the cards puts more weight on the terms selected. It also encourages a conversation around topics and concepts. During the whole process, the content strategist in the role of consultant and exercise facilitator steps back - that shows the group that it is their task and they are responsible to do the work. In the end, the deliverables are merely the result of the work of the client.  

#### Where do we go from there? [#](#where-do-we-go-from-there)

The message architecture is also the foundation for a qualitative content audit. What content do we already have and is it any good? Does it align with the message architecture and the communication goals?

#### What is a content audit? [#](#what-is-a-content-audit)

The opportunity to start a content strategy from scratch is mostly not given, so the (future) content strategist has to look up carefully what’s already there when he or she is going to guide a company through the jungle of the theoretical part of the content - before even writing the first word of the copy or collecting the pictures.

A content audit has proven its worth here. In order to determine what should be continued, what is superfluous, and what is missing, the current state of the media used must of course be determined. As there are different ways to audit content - all types have the preceding reason in common: A goal, a specific question, the message architecture - everything is a possible reason why or what is being measured. It does not make sense to perform an audit 'just because'.  

#### How to conduct a qualitative content audit [#](#how-to-conduct-a-qualitative-content-audit)

Initially, the quantity of the existing content is being gathered. For example: For a website content audit, a list of all the URLs can be put in a large spreadsheet (there are tools to do that). Next, the different content types should be examined. Are there a lot of PDFs on the web page? Are there many images (which is good)? Videos? Where are links set or is there double content? Are there dead links?

After this rough overview the quality of the content can be determined. This works in several ways. The same table can be used and evaluated against the goals, the question or the priorities of the message architecture that has been determined before. But one can also make a customer journey through the current website and check if the needs are met, if the questions are answered.

Doing the content audit is also dealing with restrictions - you need to figure out how to deal with constraints. Should you do only a strategic sample of the website? Which one is best to choose?

In order to set the right steps for a content strategy, this is one of the core deliveries to the client. At least the qualitative content audit helps to make recommendations for further content decisions.

In the class, Margot Bloomstein provides several different ‘doings’ to get her students to the topic. ‘Hands-on’ and ‘speak up’ is the overriding principle in each of her lectures.

Based on the content audit it is possible to recommend appropriate content types.  

#### What is a content type? [#](#what-is-a-content-type)

In his online glossary for web content management [Deane Barker](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/author/) defines a content type as follows: “The specification of a logical type of content–for example, a News Article or a Blog Post.” A content type can be seen as declaration of a specific piece of content that contains information. Many business owners, CEO’s or even marketers are tempted to think that a simple video makes great content. In truth, it is still the message itself that decides between good or bad content. A video is just the packaging in which the message is being wrapped in. Therefore it is crucial to select content types which support specific communication goals.

#### How to recommend appropriate content types [#](#how-to-recommend-appropriate-content-types)

After having conducted the audit the content strategist can recommend content types that fit the needs of the client. The selected content types represent the communication goals of the business, organization or company. Here is an example: If the communication goal is to be perceived as engaged and fun, is an annual report the right channel? Or is it a blog, games and videos? In other words, the choice of content types and channels manifest any communication goals that have been defined in the message architecture.

#### Finding content types: Let the Hunger Games begin [#](#finding-content-types-let-the-hunger-games-begin)

In class each of the 29 students had to recommend one or two content types based on the audit they conducted before. The challenge was that none of the recommended content types should be repeated. The question at the time was: Are there enough content types for everyone?

Here is an excerpt from the ideas that the students presented (with a special thanks to Tamara Schiffer, COS20 student, for collecting the content types throughout the session):  

*   Social Media Wall

*   Wizard for Covid19 Help

*   Infographic

*   Videos

*   Webinars with Q&A

*   Case Studies

*   FAQ and Guides for customer support

*   Quiz

*   Travel blog

*   Checklist

*   Notification

*   Pricing-range for the shops listed

The mention of the Hunger Games in the headline is just a little joke from the authors because it turned out there was enough for everyone. When speaking of content types, one first thinks of video, images and long copy. But content types can be found in every corner. CoSchedule, a marketing organization software, published [113 content type ideas](https://coschedule.com/blog/types-of-content/), many of those are not immediately thought of such as quotes or references. Furthermore this list also shows clearly that suitable content types can also be found for smaller budgets. The latter has to be considered by the content strategist when recommending content types to the client. Because in the process of aligning the content types with the message architecture internal resources like budget or personnel can get shifted and reallocated.

According to Bloomstein many (content) challenges can be tackled with these 3 steps: creating a message architecture, conducting an audit and recommending appropriate content types and channels. Deeper insights on Content modeling and editorial guidelines will be taught in specific lectures throughout the master degree of Content Strategy at FH Joanneum Graz.

#### The Brand Values class provided me with a very practical approach to creating brand-driven content strategies. Starting with the messaging architecture creation exercise, the content audit and the final assignment (which brought everything together), this class equipped me with a solid foundation. The class prompted students to think about problem solving for business goals and user needs through the lens of communication goals and story-telling, using a logical step-by-step approach. Additionally, I particularly liked the instructor’s proactive approach to encouraging student participation. It sparked some very interesting discussions around the topic.
